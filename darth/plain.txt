Bob: Hey, Alice! How are you doing? 

Alice: Hello, Bob. Nothing much to be honest, i'm just swamped with work! 

Bob: Dam that's crazy. 

Alice: yeah. 

Bob: Well hey, I want you to see something on my computer. I don't want to tell you up front. Heres my login: Bob and my enrypted password is cgDo5nUly311sMbsV0s. I encrypted my password with caesar cipher, but I cant remember the rotation. I know you love crypto Alice, so I know you will figure it out! 

Alice: uh ok?
